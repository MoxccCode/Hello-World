# Hello-World
Hi, I'm Moxcc. I'm here to learn how to code js, because it lets me create stuff. I've always been creating things through arts and crafts. Big projects are my favorites, but since I'm newbie in this I'll be tinkering with smaller ones for time being. Would be nice to find like minded friends, so give me a holler if you on the same path!
