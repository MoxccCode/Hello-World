# Hello-World
Hi, I'm Moxcc. I'm here to learn how to code js, because it allows me to create stuff. I've always been creating things through arts and crafts. Big projects are my favorites, but since I'm a newbie in this I'll be tinkering with smaller codes for a while. It would be nice to find like minded friends, so give me a holler if you're on the same path!
